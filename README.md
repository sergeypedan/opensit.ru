# OpenSit-ru

This is a fork of the original danbartlett / <a href="https://github.com/danbartlett/opensit" target="_blank">opensit</a> â€” an open source meditation community, a place where meditators can share and develop their practice.

## Work in progress!

The project is currently under construction, so do not expect it to work out of the box.
